After creating your folder, you will enter vscode to use the following command in the terminal

git clone https://github.com/Igornalves/Project_DT-Money.git
```

### Running the Project Locally

With the project already cloned you can now install all the project dependencies using the following command

```terminal
npm install
```

Now with all the dependencies installed you can run the project completely

npm run dev
```

This way you will now be able to use the website and also make changes to the project's source code.
